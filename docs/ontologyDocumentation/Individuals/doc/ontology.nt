<http://idea.rpi.edu/heals/ont/whattomake/individuals/> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The goal of this project is to create a system capable of recommending recipes to a user subject to the ingredients that user has on hand and the time they want to spend cooking. The system should also be able to recommend best-matched substitutions for ingredients where appropriate in order to meet the userâ€™s taste preferences or food allergy related needs. The users are allowed to specify the meal types (e.g. lunch) and course types (e.g. entree) in the request. If the users request not to have recipes that contain high Glycemic Index (GI) ingredients, the system will avoid offering these high glycemic recipes in the recommendations." .
